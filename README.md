# Cache-Controller
▪ Determined the best architecture for 64 kB cache that interfaces to 32bit microprocessor with a 64-bit data bus and evaluated
a Jacobi which operates on a 128x128 symmetric matrix of double-precision real floating point numbers
▪ Considered different cases (60 permutations) including set size (n-way associativity) of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16; block sizes of 1,2,4
and 16 bytes and write strategies(write-back or write-through) and executed C code using Visual Studio C++
